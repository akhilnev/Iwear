## Idea for my app ( Iwear )

Everytime I go out in school in Iowa weather is so unpredictable, temperatures vary vastly day to day and it can be extremely cold in the morning and change to warm and pleasent in the evening, I want to make an app which suggests what to wear based on the weather outside, further if we upload an image from our closet it suggest best possible combination from the clothes in our closed on a 3D model of us, further it can suggest what clothes we can possibly buy to stay current with latest trends and based on our choices, etc
